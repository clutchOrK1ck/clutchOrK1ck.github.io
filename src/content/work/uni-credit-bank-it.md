Over four years as a software engineer, I was responsible for maintaining and developing a Spring Boot–based server application for exchanging payment-related data with the SWIFT network. Additionally, I conducted business data analysis using Python, worked closely with business stakeholders on IT requirements, and performed application maintenance on Linux servers.

I’m a game developer with a long-term passion for games and a strong professional background in software engineering.

After spending five years as a Java developer working on production systems, I transitioned my focus fully toward game development. Over the years, I’ve built solid experience with Unreal Engine (C++ & Blueprints), Blender, and game-engine fundamentals, supported by a strong foundation in mathematics and 3D graphics.

I’m now looking to grow as part of a professional game-development team and contribute to real, shipped projects.

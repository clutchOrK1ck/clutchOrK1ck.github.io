## The Game

**Evil Dwarves** is a small top-down shooter game with fun bullet ricochet mechanics that I developed in UE5 as a solo during the 10 days of the [game jam](https://itch.io/jam/bullet-hell-v). This also was my first UE project that ended up as a playable game. 

## Features

- projectiles ricochet from walls at certain angles
- configurable ricochet profiles
- AI enemies with three behavior types
  - **Berserker** - a fast enemy who charges the player and performs melee attacks
  - **Sharpshooter** - will barrage the player once spotted
  - **Sapper** - moves around and plants mines making the life difficult

## Technology

To make this game I used:

- **UE5 Blueprints**, since I had little time for the whole project and needed to move very fast
- **Blender** where I myself produced all the 3d assets used in the game. I also programmed a set of tools for Blender-to-Unreal export pipeline using Blender's Python API

All the SFX used in the game were purchased online.

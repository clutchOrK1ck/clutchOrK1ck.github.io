I scripted this little endless runner as a submission for the [ShroomJam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/shroomjam-2025). I had long been interested in Godot and chose it as the game's engine. I enjoyed Godot a lot! The engine is light-weight and easy to pick up. At the same time I truly came to appreciate Unreal for how many features it gives out of the box!

## Features

- procedural generation of obstacles and the world (sprites are generated randomly and move on their treadmills)
- *speed-up*: world, character animations, and even the music speed up! which makes dodging progressively more difficult

## Technology

- I fully scripted the game in Godot
- 2D assets and animations came from my teammates
